# Contributing to Browserware

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Browserware.

## Where to Contribute

Browserware is a modular ecosystem spread across repositories in the `browserware` organization:

- **Main codebase**: `https://github.com/browserware/browserware` (monorepo with all Rust libraries and CLI)
- **Organization docs**: This repository (`.github`) holds org-wide documentation and policies
- **GUI application**: `https://github.com/browserware/browserware-gui` (private repository)

Most contributions should target the main monorepo at `https://github.com/browserware/browserware`.

## What We're Looking For

Contributions that align with Browserware's design principles:

- **Modular changes** that respect crate boundaries
- **Cross-platform solutions** (macOS, Windows, Linux parity)
- **Well-tested code** with clear documentation
- **Small, focused PRs** that are easy to review

Before starting larger work, please open an issue or discussion first.
