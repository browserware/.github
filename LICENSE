# Browserware Licensing

Open source components in the Browserware organization are dual licensed under both:

- **MIT License** ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
- **Apache License, Version 2.0** ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

You may choose either license for your use.

## Which License Should I Use?

Both licenses are permissive open source licenses. The Apache 2.0 license includes an explicit patent grant, while the MIT license is shorter and simpler.

For most purposes, either license works fine. Choose the one that best fits your project's needs.
